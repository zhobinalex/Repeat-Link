It sounds like you want to:

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step example for Termux:

---

### 1. Install git and python in Termux

```
pkg update
pkg install git python
```

### 2. Clone a GitHub Repository

Replace the URL with the repo you want:
```
git clone https://github.com/zhobinalex/Repeat-Link.git
```

### 3. Enter the Cloned Folder

```
cd Repeat-Link
```

### 4. List Python Files

pip install -r requirements.txt
```
after setup 

### 5. Run a Python File
```
repeat.py
```

---

**Summary:**  
- git clone (to download the repo)
- cd <repo> (go into the folder)
- python <file.py> (run the Python script)

Let me know if you want this process automated, or if you need a script to search for and run a Python file automatically!
