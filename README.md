It sounds like you want to:

1. Clone a GitHub repository using git clone in Termux.
2. Work with a Python file (*.py) inside the cloned folder.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step example for Termux:

---

### 1. Install git and python in Termux

```
pkg update
pkg install git python
```

### 2. Clone a GitHub Repository

Replace the URL with the repo you want:
```
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
```

### 3. Enter the Cloned Folder

```
cd repository
```

### 4. List Python Files

```
ls *.py
```

### 5. Run a Python File

For example, to run a file called `main.py`:
```
python main.py
```

---

**Summary:**  
- git clone (to download the repo)
- cd <repo> (go into the folder)
- python <file.py> (run the Python script)

Let me know if you want this process automated, or if you need a script to search for and run a Python file automatically!
